# What should the Church look like?

## Preface
In an effort to follow our Lord most faithfully we are obliged as Christians to assess our beliefs and verify that they coincide with what has been revealed to our spiritual fathers and written in the new testament. In this pursuit we must ask ourselves, does the church I'm apart of look like the Church described in the Bible? This will not be a comprehensive study as to which denomination, or Church most faithfully corresponds to the biblical model of the new testament church, however this is a collection of history and scripture that should narrow the list. This is merely an effort to lay out the bare minimum that is suggested to be either the practice of or explicit teaching of the new testament authors regarding the structure and practices of the Church. To be explicit with the goal of this paper, the aim is to prove the existance of atleast a 3 tier office in the church.

## Introducing the Roles
To begin we must address the first issue that arrises when trying to discuss offices. The names of these offices are not expected to be found in scripture as we named the offices after scripture. For example, What we can expect to find however is evidence that 3 offices do exist and they they function in 3 ways. A servent role, a pastoring and priestly role, and an priestly and overseer role. hows this

## Breakdown of Priest
Priest is a broad word that can and does mean different things depending on whos using it.

Here are a few examples with the corrosponding proper term that was used instead of the word priest:

1. The Jews of the old testament had Priests(kōhēn)
2. Jesus is called the Great High Priest(hiereus)
3. The early church had priest(_presbyteros_)
4. We have preists today(priest)

To elaborate

Priest is used as a word to represent an office. In the old testament, the office of priesthood was called _kōhēn_ meaning literally "one who offers sacrifices".

This same office is described in the new testament by its authors who wrote in Greek, they used the word _hiereus_ meaning the same thing as the previous word.

We see here that here 2 words mean the exact same thing, and have been replaced in our translations as priest accordingly. Now for the new testament thats when things start to get a little different. We no longer have someone who sacrifices at the alter so a new word is used after Jesus as the final High priest. The word _presbyteros_ is used, this word refers to elder.
