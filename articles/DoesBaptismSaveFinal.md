## What is Baptism?

To begin answering if baptism actually does something, we need to first clarify exactly what baptism is. Probably the most popular idea in modern America of baptism is the idea professed by Baptist, Evangelical, and Pentecostal communities—something I will refer to as the **Symbolic view**. That is, you are saved when you receive the Holy Spirit through your faith in Christ, then you are baptized as a sign of that faith; and the reason you are baptized is because Jesus commanded it in the New Testament. However, this understanding is relatively recent in history and cannot be found in the writings of the earliest Christians. So, what gives? Well, I’m here to posit a different, more traditional view, what I’ll refer to as the **Regenerative view**, which says God allows us to have faith, which leads us to be baptized in water to receive the Holy Spirit and have our sins forgiven.

The division between these two views comes down to two main points:

1. **Relation between water and the Holy Spirit**
    
    - **Symbolic View:** The Spirit is received through faith, something completely separate from water.
        
    - **Regenerative View:** The Spirit is received in baptism, water and Spirit being connected.
        
2. **The necessity of Baptism**
    
    - **Symbolic View:** Baptism does not regenerate, nor wash away sin, nor save.
        
    - **Regenerative View:** Baptism regenerates, and washes away all sin, and saves.
        

Let’s now look into the Old Testament to see how God prepared His people to understand baptism.

## What does the Old Testament say?

Our two key questions are whether the Holy Spirit is connected to water and whether water saves. Let’s examine the Old Testament for evidence of these patterns—looking for passages that connect water and Spirit, show water bringing salvation, or demonstrate both.

In Genesis 1:2, it says, "And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters." This is the second verse in the Bible, and we’ve already seen a verse say that the Spirit of God moved over the waters. Next, we see in the flood, Noah and his wife and his sons and his sons' wives are saved by water in the ark. After the waters cleanse the earth, Noah sends out a dove; when the dove enters the world and does not return, Noah knows the earth has been made new and is ready for dwelling. If you’ll recall what image the Holy Spirit takes on in the New Testament (recall Luke 3:22, "And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him..."), it's made clear that God cleansed or saved the world by water, and when this was happening, the Holy Spirit was able to dwell in the world, as it had been made new.

In regards to the cleansing nature of the water itself in baptism, I’d like to also mention the story of Naaman the Syrian, who was a man with leprosy who went to see the prophet Elisha in 2 Kings 5.

> "So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha: And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying: Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thou shalt be clean. Naaman was angry and went away..."

It's revealed the reason Naaman is angry is that he expected the prophet to come out, lay his hands on him, and heal him; but instead, he was told to go wash in water, to which Naaman said:

> "Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean?"

Naaman seems to be puzzled as to why washing in the Jordan would be beneficial as it's just regular water; there is much better water nearby that he could wash in and get cleaner. Naaman is missing Elisha’s point; the command to wash was (as Peter puts it) "not as a removal of dirt from the body." Elisha is commanding Naaman to wash as an appeal to God. Eventually, Naaman decides to listen to Elisha’s command.

> "Then he went down, and washed in the Jordan seven times: according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean." After this, Naaman declared, _"In truth, I know there is no other God in all the earth, but only in Israel."_

His flesh was regenerated by the water to that of a little child. And as we read, he was made clean and, from then on, he followed the Lord.

Continuing to look for a connection between water and Spirit, we can't look past probably the most direct verse found in Ezekiel 36:25-27:

> "**_And I will pour upon you clean water_**, and you shall be **cleansed from all your filthiness**, and I will cleanse you from all your idols. **And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit** **within you**: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh. And **_I will put my spirit in the midst of you_**: and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them."

God clearly tells Ezekiel that He will pour clean water on us, which will cleanse us from all our filthiness (wash away sin), He will give us a new heart (save us), and He will put His Spirit within us (receiving the Spirit through the water). These are not the only passages that discuss water and Spirit in the Old Testament either, but they are enough to get the point across that this was the idea from even before the time of Christ.

## What does the New Testament say?

We’ve seen in the Old Testament how water and Spirit are tied to each other for salvation and regeneration, so now let us look at how Jesus and the apostles fulfill this pattern fully in the New Testament. To begin, let’s look at John 3:5; during a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus, Nicodemus acknowledges Christ's miracles as from God, and the following conversation ensues:

> 'Truly, truly I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' Nicodemus saith to him: 'How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?' Jesus answered: 'Truly, truly I say to thee, unless a man be born of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'

In the symbolic view, some argue that "born of water" refers to natural birth. But looking at the passage, how can this be? Christ first proclaims, "unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus asks how this second birth happens, and Christ answers, "unless a man be born **_of water and the Holy Ghost_**, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." The flow is clear—Christ introduces a second birth, Nicodemus asks for clarification, and Jesus explains that this rebirth happens through water and the Holy Spirit. The whole time Christ is talking about a second birth, a being born again; **Nicodemus asks how to be born again, and Christ responds with how to be born again.** Nowhere do we see the conversation shift to some combination of being born normally and then our rebirth later by the Holy Spirit alone—this is simply reading a presupposed theology into the verse.

Furthermore, why would natural birth be described as "born of water"? This phrase _never_ appears elsewhere in Scripture to describe physical birth. The Bible uses phrases like "born of woman" (Job 14:1, Matthew 11:11)—if Jesus meant natural birth, this would have been the natural phrasing. And why would Jesus make natural birth a requirement for salvation? That would be like saying, "Unless you exist and have the Holy Spirit, you cannot enter the kingdom." Obviously we must exist; why state it as a condition? The "water" must refer to something more than mere physical birth—it refers to baptism, the means by which we are born again of water and Spirit.

Continuing to look at what the New Testament says on its own about baptism, let's look at Acts 2:38-41:

> Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: _What shall we do, men and brethren?_ (38) But Peter said to them: _Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ_, **_for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost._** (39) For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call. (40) And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: _Save yourselves from this perverse generation._ (41) They therefore that received his word, were baptized; **and there were added in that day about three thousand souls**.

Here we read Peter was finished preaching to the Jews, to which they felt compunction (guilty). They then ask Peter what shall we do now that they have heard the good news, to which Peter instructs them: Repent, and then tells them to be baptized "for" (Greek: εἰς, indicating purpose—"in order to" or "unto") the remission of sins, **_and_** you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Peter clearly states here that after hearing the good news, we are meant to repent, then to be baptized in order to have our sins forgiven, in which we will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Nothing in this passage indicates a separation between the water of baptism and the Holy Spirit, nor do we see any indication that baptism is separate from our "remission of sins." In fact, it's explicitly stated—not merely indicated—that baptism is **_for_** the purpose of receiving forgiveness and the Holy Spirit. This is Peter's response to "What shall we do?"; we see clearly the remedy for sin is repentance and baptism, which brings forth forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Following this, we'll look at Mark 16:16, which is a controversial passage for many reasons that are outside of the scope of this article; in spite of this, for readers who take scripture to a high standard, using this passage should be of no issue.

> “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. **He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved**; but **he that believeth not shall be damned**.”

A summary of this text is unnecessary as it is abundantly clear. Part one of the verse: "**He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved**"; and part two: "**but he that believeth not shall be damned**." Both I and those who hold to a symbolic view agree with part two; it's written right there, how can you deny it? So why do those who hold to a symbolic view not accept part one? It's just as clear; it is written very straightforward with no room for ambiguity. It seems that a preconceived theology is preventing proponents of the symbolic view from accepting what Scripture plainly states. When we approach Scripture willing to let it shape our beliefs rather than forcing our beliefs onto Scripture, the regenerative view becomes unavoidable. See this [[https://youtu.be/TfHjFNOfsL8?t=2158](https://youtu.be/TfHjFNOfsL8?t=2158)] for a complete breakdown of the logic of this verse if you are still unconvinced.

Connecting something we looked at earlier in Genesis with Noah and his family, we look now to Saint Peter, who in 1 Peter 3:19-21 proclaims the connection we described earlier to be true.

> "In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison: (20) Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noah, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. (21) Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

Our connection earlier that Noah and his family were saved by water through the cleansing of sin on the earth is directly confirmed. Peter confirms that the eight on the ark "were saved by water" of the flood and that this action of water saving the eight now corresponds to baptism: "**_Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also_**."

Recall what Naaman the Syrian thought when he was told the water would cleanse him:

> "Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean?"

He was angry that Elisha had told him to wash in water that Naaman thought wasn't clean enough for him. Well, now here we see through Peter the point is "**not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.**" Or put simply: baptism's power is not in removing dirt from the body, but in cleansing the conscience through Christ's resurrection. Like Naaman, we must understand that the water works not by its physical properties, but by God's promise attached to it. Peter confirms what we saw foreshadowed in the Old Testament—water saves, not as a bath for the body, but as the means by which God regenerates the soul.

Lastly, I’d like to cover Paul who, upon seeing Christ, has faith and calls Him his Lord:

> "What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do."

So Paul has faith that Christ is his Lord; this is obvious. Now when Paul arrives in Damascus, Paul meets Ananias, who tells Paul this:

> "And now why tarriest thou? Rise up, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, invoking his name."

So we've already seen that Paul has faith—enough faith to walk to another city and find a man that Christ told him to find. But when he meets Ananias, Ananias says, "And now why tarriest thou?" or "Why are you delaying?" He then tells him to rise and be baptized and wash away his sins. This clearly teaches us that when Paul believed, his sins were **not** yet washed away—they still needed to be forgiven through baptism. _Ananias doesn't say_ "outwardly profess the forgiveness you already received." He commands Paul to be baptized **_in order to_** **wash away** his sins. Forgiveness happens in baptism, not before it.

These are some of the main claims of the New Testament that I think show clearly the regenerative view, both that the Spirit is connected with the water and that baptism itself is necessary. Now, addressing a few small things before moving onto the early church section: No, baptism being necessary, as said by Christ Himself, does not imply those not baptized have no chance of heaven. The thief on the cross was likely not baptized, but we know he is in Heaven. The regenerative view does not limit God; God is in control of the salvation of whomever He chooses, be it the thief on the cross or children who die unbaptized. The Lord may save whomever He chooses; the regenerative view only posits that God established baptism as the normative path to salvation.

## What does the Early Church say?

For the purposes of this article, I will limit the scope of “the Early Church” to the period between Christ’s death and the year 400. While the year 381 is often noted as the point at which the canon of Scripture was formally articulated, this broader range is useful for a simple reason: Christians who disagree with the Church as it exists today often still rely on the very biblical canon that was recognized and preserved by that early Church.

Most believers regard the selection of books in the Bible as divinely guided. Put plainly, if the people who identified and preserved the books that now make up Scripture are trusted in that task, it is reasonable to grant them some weight when it comes to doctrine as well. Even so, this point is not strictly necessary for the argument, as our first example dates to immediately after the New Testament had finished being written.

[But] a viper of the [Gnostic] Cainite heresy, lately conversant in this quarter, has carried away a great number with her most venomous doctrine, making it her first aim to destroy baptism—which is quite in accordance with nature, for vipers and asps . . . themselves generally do live in arid and waterless places. But we, little fishes after the example of our [Great] Fish, Jesus Christ, are born in water, nor have we safety in any other way than by permanently abiding in water. So that most monstrous creature, who had no right to teach even sound doctrine, knew full well how to kill the little fishes—by taking them away from the water!”

He had come through water and blood, as John wrote [1 John 5:6], so that he might be baptized with water and glorified with blood. . . .
