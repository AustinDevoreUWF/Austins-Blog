## What is Baptism?

To begin answering if baptism actually does something, we need to first clarify exactly what baptism is. Probably the most popular idea in modern America of baptism is the idea professed by Baptist, Evangelical, and Pentecostal communities—something I will refer to as the **Symbolic view**. That is, you are saved when you receive the Holy Spirit through your faith in Christ, then you are baptized as a sign of that faith; and the reason you are baptized is because Jesus commanded it in the New Testament. However, this understanding is relatively recent in history and cannot be found in the writings of the earliest Christians. So, what gives? Well, I’m here to posit a different, more traditional view, what I’ll refer to as the **Regenerative view**, which says God allows us to have faith, which leads us to be baptized in water to receive the Holy Spirit and have our sins forgiven.

The division between these two views comes down to two main points:

1. **Relation between water and the Holy Spirit**
    
    - **Symbolic View:** The Spirit is received through faith, something completely separate from water.
        
    - **Regenerative View:** The Spirit is received in baptism, water and Spirit being connected.
        
2. **The necessity of Baptism**
    
    - **Symbolic View:** Baptism does not regenerate, nor wash away sin, nor save.
        
    - **Regenerative View:** Baptism regenerates, and washes away all sin, and saves.
        

Let’s now look into the Old Testament to see how God prepared His people to understand baptism.

## What does the Old Testament say?

Our two key questions are whether the Holy Spirit is connected to water and whether water saves. Let’s examine the Old Testament for evidence of these patterns—looking for passages that connect water and Spirit, show water bringing salvation, or demonstrate both.

In Genesis 1:2, it says, "And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters." This is the second verse in the Bible, and we’ve already seen a verse say that the Spirit of God moved over the waters. Next, we see in the flood, Noah and his wife and his sons and his sons' wives are saved by water in the ark. After the waters cleanse the earth, Noah sends out a dove; when the dove enters the world and does not return, Noah knows the earth has been made new and is ready for dwelling. If you’ll recall what image the Holy Spirit takes on in the New Testament (recall Luke 3:22, "And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him..."), it's made clear that God cleansed or saved the world by water, and when this was happening, the Holy Spirit was able to dwell in the world, as it had been made new.

In regards to the cleansing nature of the water itself in baptism, I’d like to also mention the story of Naaman the Syrian, who was a man with leprosy who went to see the prophet Elisha in 2 Kings 5.

> "So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha: And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying: Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thou shalt be clean. Naaman was angry and went away..."

It's revealed the reason Naaman is angry is that he expected the prophet to come out, lay his hands on him, and heal him; but instead, he was told to go wash in water in the river Jordan, to which Naaman said:

> "Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean?"

Naaman seems to be puzzled as to why washing in the Jordan would be beneficial as it's just regular water; there is much better water nearby that he could wash in and get cleaner. Naaman is missing Elisha’s point; the command to wash was (as Peter puts it) "not as a removal of dirt from the body." Elisha is commanding Naaman to wash as an appeal to God. Eventually, Naaman decides to listen to Elisha’s command.

> "Then he went down, and washed in the Jordan seven times: according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean."
> 
> After this, Naaman declared, "In truth, I know there is no other God in all the earth, but only in Israel."

His flesh was regenerated by the water to that of a little child. And as we read, he was made clean and, from then on, he followed the Lord.

Continuing to look for a connection between water and Spirit, we can't look past probably the most direct verse found in Ezekiel 36:25-27:

> "**_And I will pour upon you clean water_**, and you shall be **cleansed from all your filthiness**, and I will cleanse you from all your idols. **And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit** **within you**: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh. And **_I will put my spirit in the midst of you_**: and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do t1hem."

God clearly tells Ezekiel that He will pour clean water on us, which will cleanse us from all our filthiness (wash away sin), He will give us a new heart (save us), and He will put His Spirit within us (receiving the Spirit through the water). These are not the only passages that discuss water and Spirit in the Old Testament either, but they are enough to get the point across that this was the idea from even before the time of Christ.

## What does the New Testament say?

We’ve seen in the Old Testament how water and Spirit are tied to each other for salvation and regeneration, so now let us look at how Jesus and the apostles fulfill this pattern fully in the New Testament. To begin, let’s look at John 3:5; during a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus, Nicodemus acknowledges Christ's miracles as from God, and the following conversation ensues:

> 'Truly, truly I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' Nicodemus saith to him: 'How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?' Jesus answered: 'Truly, truly I say to thee, unless a man be born of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'

In the symbolic view, some argue that "born of water" refers to natural birth. But looking at the passage, how can this be? Christ first proclaims, "unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus asks how this second birth happens, and Christ answers, "unless a man be born **_of water and the Holy Ghost_**, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." The flow is clear—Christ introduces a second birth, Nicodemus asks for clarification, and Jesus explains that this rebirth happens through water and the Holy Spirit. The whole time Christ is talking about a second birth, a being born again; **Nicodemus asks how to be born again, and Christ responds with how to be born again.** Nowhere do we see the conversation shift to some combination of being born normally and then our rebirth later by the Holy Spirit alone—this is simply reading a presupposed theology into the verse.

Furthermore, why would natural birth be described as "born of water"? This phrase _never_ appears elsewhere in Scripture to describe physical birth. The Bible uses phrases like "born of woman" (Job 14:1, Matthew 11:11)—if Jesus meant natural birth, this would have been the natural phrasing. And why would Jesus make natural birth a requirement for salvation? That would be like saying, "Unless you exist and have the Holy Spirit, you cannot enter the kingdom." Obviously we must exist; why state it as a condition? The "water" must refer to something more than mere physical birth—it refers to baptism, the means by which we are born again of water and Spirit.

Continuing to look at what the New Testament says on its own about baptism, let's look at Acts 2:38-41:

> Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: _What shall we do, men and brethren?_ (38) But Peter said to them: _Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ_, **_for the remission of your 2sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost._** (39) For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call. (40) And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: _Save yourselves from this perverse generati3on._ (41) They therefore that received his word, were baptized; **and there were added in that day about three thousand 4souls**.

Here we read Peter was finished preaching to the Jews, to which they felt compunction (guilty). They then ask Peter what shall we do now that they have heard the good news, to which Peter instructs them: Repent, and then tells them to be baptized "for" (Greek: εἰς, indicating purpose—"in order to" or "unto") the remission of sins, **_and_** you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Peter clearly states here that after hearing the good news, we are meant to repent, then to be baptized in order to have our sins forgiven, in which we will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Nothing in this passage indicates a separation between the water of baptism and the Holy Spirit, nor do we see any indication that baptism is separate from our "remission of sins." In fact, it's explicitly stated—not merely indicated—that baptism is **_for_** the purpose of receiving forgiveness and the Holy Spirit. This is Peter's response to "What shall we do?"; we see clearly the remedy for sin is repentance and baptism, which brings forth forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Notice something here: those who received Peter's message were baptized, and **three thousand souls were added to the Church that day**. They weren't considered part of the Church when they believed Peter's words—they were added _after_ baptism. **Baptism was the entry point into the Christian community**, not merely a public declaration of membership they already had.

Following this, we'll look at Mark 16:16, which is a controversial passage for many reasons that are outside of the scope of this article; in spite of this, for readers who take scripture to a high standard, using this passage should be of no issue.

> “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
> 
> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”

A summary of this text is unnecessary as it is abundantly clear. Part one of the verse: "**He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved**"; and part two: "**but he that believeth not shall be damned**." Both I and those who hold to a symbolic view agree with part two; it's written right there, how can you deny it? So why do those who hold to a symbolic view not accept part one? It's just as clear; it is written very straightforward with no room for ambiguity. It seems that a preconceived theology is preventing proponents of the symbolic view from accepting what Scripture plainly states. When we approach Scripture willing to let it shape our beliefs rather than forcing our beliefs onto Scripture, the regenerative view becomes unavoidable. See this [[https://youtu.be/TfHjFNOfsL8?t=2158](https://youtu.be/TfHjFNOfsL8?t=2158)] for a complete breakdown of the logic of this verse if you are still unconvinced.

Connecting something we looked at earlier in Genesis with Noah and his family, we look now to Saint Peter, who in 1 Peter 3:19-21 proclaims the connection we described earlier to be true.

> "In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison: (20) Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noah, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. (21) Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

Our connection earlier that Noah and his family were saved by water through the cleansing of sin on the earth is directly confirmed. Peter confirms that the eight on the ark "were saved by water" of the flood and that this action of water saving the eight now corresponds to baptism: "**_Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also_**."

Recall what Naaman the Syrian thought when he was told the water would cleanse him:

> "Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean?"

He was angry that Elisha had told him to wash in water that Naaman thought wasn't clean enough for him. Well, now here we see through Peter the point is "**not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.**" Or put simply: baptism's power is not in removing dirt from the body, but in cleansing the conscience through Christ's resurrection. Like Naaman, we must understand that the water works not by its physical properties, but by God's promise attached to it. Peter confirms what we saw foreshadowed in the Old Testament—water saves, not as a bath for the body, but as the means by which God regenerates the soul.

Next, I’d like to cover Paul who, upon seeing Christ, has faith and calls Him his Lord:

> "What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do."

So Paul has faith that Christ is his Lord; this is obvious. Now when Paul arrives in Damascus, Paul meets Ananias, who tells Paul this:

> "And now why tarriest thou? Rise up, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, invoking his name."

So we've already seen that Paul has faith—enough faith to walk to another city and find a man that Christ told him to find. But when he meets Ananias, Ananias says, "And now why tarriest thou?" or "Why are you delaying?" He then tells him to rise and be baptized and wash away his sins. This clearly teaches us that when Paul believed, his sins were **not** yet washed away—they still needed to be forgiven through baptism. _Ananias doesn't say_ "outwardly profess the forgiveness you already received." He commands Paul to be baptized **_in order to_** **wash away** his sins. Forgiveness happens in baptism, not before it.

Something important that must be addressed:
 The Special Case of Cornelius

Acts 10 records something unique: Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit before baptism. Doesn't this contradict baptismal regeneration?

**Understanding the Context:** We must remember what's at stake in Acts 10. The early Church was **entirely Jewish.** The apostles assumed Gentiles had to become Jews first (circumcision, dietary laws, etc.) to become Christians. Peter himself had never entered a Gentile home—it was considered defiling.

Then God gives Peter a vision (the sheet with unclean animals) and tells him to go to Cornelius's house. Peter goes, but he's uncertain. When he starts preaching, something unprecedented happens: the Holy Spirit falls on these uncircumcised Gentiles.

**Why This Happened:** _This wasn't about making baptism optional_. It was about proving to Peter and the Jewish Christians that Gentiles could be saved _as Gentiles_—without becoming Jews first. The visible outpouring of the Spirit was undeniable proof. Peter's response confirms this: "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" (v. 47). He's saying: "God has clearly accepted them—who are we to refuse?". God needed to dramatically change Peter's mind and show him that Gentiles are part of God's plan of salvation. Without this extraordinary sign, Peter may not have been able to accept that uncircumcised Gentiles could become Christians—and the Jerusalem church certainly wouldn't have believed him (notice how in Acts 11 he has to defend his actions). The Spirit falling on Cornelius wasn't establishing a new pattern where baptism is optional; it was breaking down the Jewish-Gentile barrier that threatened to divide the Church. And we know it could have divided the church, as the first church council was held over this exact dispute, in which Peter proclaims:

> "And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;" Acts 15:8

**Baptism Still Required:** Critically, **Peter immediately commanded them to be baptized** (v. 48). If receiving the Spirit made baptism unnecessary, this makes no sense. But if baptism remains necessary for salvation, Peter's command is perfectly consistent—even after the Spirit's extraordinary coming, baptism was still required.

**The Exception Proves the Rule:** Throughout Acts, the pattern is consistent: believe, be baptized, receive forgiveness and the Spirit (Acts 2:38). Cornelius is the _only_ exception, used for a specific historical purpose—to open the Church to Gentiles. **But even in this exceptional case, baptism remained necessary.**

Lastly we look at the disciples of John the Baptist in Acts 19:1-6. These were men who followed Christs Cousin, John in the wilderness, lets look at the passage in whole and break it down step by step.

>And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples. (2)And he said to them: **Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?** But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost. (3)And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism. (4)Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus. (5)Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. (6)And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, **the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.**

Reading this passage, you should immediately recognize the same pattern we've seen throughout Acts: faith, then baptism, which results in receiving the Holy Spirit.

Notice Paul's question: **"Have you received the Holy Ghost _since ye believed?_"** This clearly indicates these disciples of John _already believed_ in Christ—yet they had not received the Holy Spirit and had never even heard of Him. How is this possible if faith alone brings the Spirit?

Paul immediately asks the diagnostic question: "In what then were you baptized?" They answer: "In John's baptism"—a baptism of repentance pointing forward to Christ, but not the sacramental baptism Christ instituted. Paul recognizes this isn't sufficient. So what does he do?

**He baptizes them immediately in the name of the Lord Jesus.** And what happens the moment Paul imposes hands on them in baptism? **"The Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."**

If the symbolic view is correct, whats the deal with these disciples of John? **Why didnt they obtain the Holy Spirit upon their belief in Christ?** Simple, *because the Holy Spirit is fully revealed in us through the sacrament of water baptism.*

These are some of the main claims of the New Testament that I think show clearly the regenerative view, both that the Spirit is connected with the water and that baptism itself is necessary. Now, addressing a few small things before moving onto the early church section: No, baptism being necessary, as said by Christ Himself, does not imply those not baptized have no chance of heaven. The thief on the cross was likely not baptized, but we know he is in Heaven due to his baptism of desire(this is elaborated on in the early church section). The regenerative view does not limit God; God is in control of the salvation of whomever He chooses, be it the thief on the cross or children who die unbaptized. The Lord may save whomever He chooses; the regenerative view only posits that God established baptism as the normative path to salvation.

## What does the Early Church say?

For the purposes of this article, I will limit the scope of “the Early Church” to the period between Christ’s death and around the year 400. While the year 381 is often noted as the point at which the canon of Scripture was formally articulated, this broader range is useful for a simple reason: Christians who disagree with the Church as it exists today often still rely on the very biblical canon that was recognized and preserved by that early Church.

Most believers regard the selection of books in the Bible as divinely guided. Put plainly, if the people who identified and preserved the books that now make up Scripture are trusted in that task, it is reasonable to grant them some weight when it comes to doctrine as well. Even so, this point is not strictly necessary for the argument, as our first example dates to likely before the New Testament had finished being written.

Now,

The reason these quotes are crucial is simple: they tell us what the earliest Christians—the students of the apostles themselves—actually believed and taught about baptism.

Consider which scenario is more plausible:

**Scenario 1:** Jesus taught the apostles that baptism regenerates and saves. The apostles taught this to their students (the Church Fathers). These men faithfully passed on what they received, writing it down for future generations. This is why **_we find universal agreement on baptismal regeneration_** in the early Church.

**Scenario 2:** Jesus taught the apostles **that baptism is merely symbolic**. But somehow, within just a few decades, the apostles' own students—men who sat under their teaching—completely misunderstood and reversed one of the most important doctrines of the faith—**claiming actually Jesus taught it was necessary to be baptized in water. Every single early Christian writer got it backwards.** And this catastrophic error went uncorrected and unchallenged for 1,500 years until the Reformation.

**Which is more believable?** That the apostles accurately passed on what Jesus taught, or that they universally failed to preserve the correct understanding of salvation itself?

Remember what is at stake if you hold to the symbolic view: you are claiming that _every Christian for 1,500 years_ was wrong about salvation—**including the direct students of the apostles themselves.** You are asserting that men who learned at the feet of _John, Peter, and Paul somehow completely misunderstood the Gospel_. You are denying the unanimous testimony of **the entire early Church, which with one voice proclaimed that water baptism regenerates and saves.**

### Hermas

> “‘I have heard, sir,’ said I [to the Shepherd], ‘from some teacher, **that there is no other repentance except that which took place when we went down into the water and obtained the remission of our former sins**.’ He said to me5, ‘You have heard rightly, for so it is.’”

> “As many as are persuaded and believe that what we [Christians] teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly . . . are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, ‘Except you be born again, you shall not enter into the kingdom of h6eaven’ [John 3:3].”
> 
> — _First Apology_ 61

This is as clear as it gets and this was only written 50 years after the death of John the apostle. Clearly teaching that _ONCE_ people are persuaded that Christianity is true, they are brought to water and regenerated, **BECAUSE** Christ says, **‘Except you be born again, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven’ [John 3:3].**

Here is your text with the spelling, grammar, and punctuation corrected while keeping your original wording and structure exactly as you wrote it.
Responding to Questions:

Here is one question that I’ve broken up into Q1 and Q2 to more accurately address each.
Question 1: There seem to be two types of Baptism, one before and one after Christ’s death. The Baptism before seems to be more in line with the symbolic view, while the Baptism after seems to be more linked to Christ’s death. Here I will address the very real "two Baptisms" I didn’t mention enough in the article.
Response 1: Understanding John’s Baptism of Repentance:

There are, in fact, two distinctly different baptisms in the New Testament; the Bible calls these John’s Baptism of Repentance and Christ’s Baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire. John’s baptism is specifically meant to prefigure the real baptism to come, meaning John’s baptism was supposed to perform the act and get the person ready to receive God in the full baptism of Christ, which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Fire, as we see here:

    Matthew 3:5–6, 11: "Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. ... I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I... he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."

(Something to keep in mind here is John knows that Christ will institute Baptism to obtain the Holy Ghost; this was something told to him by God.)

Here John has said though he baptizes with water to promote repentance, he does not yet have the fullness of baptism, hence "but he that cometh after me is mightier than I." He then tells us that Christ will baptize us with the Holy Ghost and with fire. Now we know what the Holy Ghost is, but it might not be clear what is meant by fire; fire here is referring to the cleansing of sin. We can see this in the book that Jesus himself reads from, and very clearly the most cited book in the Old Testament for prophecies of the New, that being Isaiah (6:6–7).

    "And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar. And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed."

We see here that Isaiah was given a coal still on fire, and God uses this fire to cleanse his sins so that he can enter Heaven and talk to God. He was unable to approach Heaven without first having his sins taken away. This is what is meant by the Holy Ghost and Fire.

We see there are, in fact, two baptisms; but as St. Jerome puts it, "John baptized for the remission of sins, but the remission was in hope and promise, not in actual effect... for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given." And we also see John, the cousin of Jesus, say that Christ will come, and when He comes, He will have the fullness of baptism; so whatever Baptism Christ has, it must be more than the symbolic baptism of John—this is explicitly taught in Scripture. Let’s not forget, when Paul found out that the followers of Jesus who previously followed John were given only John’s baptism and not Jesus’s, this is what happened:

    "And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost. (3) And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism. (4) Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus. (5) Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. (6) And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."

Response 2: The baptism of regeneration comes after the symbolic baptism of John

Now we must notice the citations offered in the article. The objection is that the symbolic view is what is in effect after Christ’s death. Firstly, here I will show that this is not the case, then in the next question I will show how this is harmonized perfectly with Scripture. But on the case that the symbolic view is in effect after Christ’s death, notice that the citations used largely come from the apostles after the time of Christ’s resurrection. Notice: Acts 2:38–41, Mark 16:16, 1 Peter 3:19–21, Acts 22:10, Acts 19:1–6. These are the citations provided; each of these examples of Baptism being either commanded as saving and gifting the Holy Ghost, or explicitly shown as saving and gifting the Holy Ghost, comes after Christ has saved us on the cross. But how can we say Baptism saves us if Christ saved us with His death on the cross? See the next question.
Question 2: If Christ died on the cross to save us from our sins, then how can we say Baptism saves? If we say Baptism saves, are we saying it was unnecessary for Christ to offer himself up for us?
Response 1: How Baptism and Christ's death both save us:

This distinction is very clear once we clear up how we are thinking about this. We are not pitting Christ’s death and resurrection against the baptism He established; but since He did establish both of these things, how do we understand this? If Christ said we have to be baptized (which we saw He did say) and that He is the only way to salvation (which He also said), then how do we harmonize these two claims? In short, Christ's death is the source of our salvation, while Baptism is the means by which that salvation actually reaches us. A really good analogy of this is this:

Who would you say healed you when you were sick? Was it the doctor you visited, or was it the medication they prescribed?

In reality, both are true. We can say the doctor saved us because, without their knowledge and authority, we would never have had access to the cure. But we can also say the "means by which" we were saved was the medication itself.

Consider this: if a doctor prescribes a specific medicine and tells us it is necessary for our recovery, we wouldn't expect to get better by simply saying, "I have faith that the doctor will heal me" while refusing to take the pill. True faith in the doctor is shown by following the prescription. Taking the medicine isn't "saving yourself" or "earning" your health; it is simply the way the doctor chose to deliver the healing to you.

In the same way, Christ is our Physician. His death on the Cross created the "medicine" of immortality, but He has prescribed Baptism as the way that medicine is administered to our souls. It is true that Christ saves us, but it is also true that the specific way He chose to do it is through the water.

The apostles understood this perfectly—that's why they preached both Christ's death AND the necessity of baptism. They're not competing truths; they're complementary truths about how God saves us.

## Closing
The Old Testament points it out, the New Testament clearly teaches it, and the entire Christian faith proclaimed it for 1,500 years. Even now, the vast majority of Christians—Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, still hold to the regenerative view. The symbolic view is popular primarily in Evangelical and Baptist circles, which represent a minority within global Christianity. However, these communities loudly pronounce the ease of faith in Christ, this idea is extremely dangerous. We cannot have faith in Christ without obeying his commandments. 

>"Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.(20) But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"

Faith without obedience to Christ is dead. To obey Christ is not easy—it requires more than many are willing to give. Christ did not come to make faith comfortable.

>**"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (Matthew 5:17).** 

He warned us:
>**"The gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life" (Matthew 7:14).**
